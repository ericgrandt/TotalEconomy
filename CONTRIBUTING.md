We are always looking for talented people to help continue making Total Economy great! If you are interested in contributing code, we ask that you follow a few guidelines.

### Getting Started

+ Find an issue with the `help wanted` label that you'd like to work on.
+ Create a branch off the branch you are targeting, most of the time `develop`, and name it `issue/[ISSUE#]-short-description-of-issue`. The short description should be no more than 4 words long.

### Code Style

**Indentation**
+ Use tabs for indentation

**File Header**
+ The top of new files must contain the license, which can be found at the top of [TotalEconomy.java](https://github.com/Erigitic/TotalEconomy/blob/develop/src/main/java/com/erigitic/main/TotalEconomy.java#L1-L24)

**Javadoc**
+ Javadoc should be present for every class and function, except for self-explanatoryÂ functions
+ The summary should accurately describe the class, function, etc.
+ Do not use @author
+ The first letter of a block tags (`@param`, `@return`, etc.) description must be capitalized

**Variables**
+ Constants should be all uppercase letters with any words separated by underscores
+ One variable per line, even if they're the same type

**Annotations**
+ Annotations should appear after the documentation and on their own line

Besides the above, try to follow the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html), and the style of the rest of the code. Don't worry too much about getting this exact, we'll be sure to point out any style issues if there are any.
