# Contributing to Total Economy
Thanks for your interest in contributing to Total Economy. There are a few guidelines that I would like contributors to follow to make the process as easy as possible.

### Contributing Code
* Fork the repository
* Create a new branch from ‘develop'. Use slash notation (e.g. feature/feature-name)
    * Types:
        * feature
        * fix
        * update
* Follow the same format/style as the rest of the code
* Test the change/addition and make sure nothing was accidently broken
* Make sure your commit message clearly describes the change/addition and includes the issue number if one exists
* Submit a pull request

### Git Commit Message
* Keep length of first line to 72 characters or less
* Use present tense (e.g. “Update” instead of “Updated”)
* Include any new commands/permissions/nodes/etc. and a description for each for easy addition to documentation. New line for each one.
